## Overview
As every Dart project [`main.dart`](lib/main.dart) is the starting point of app.

Next we'll have an entery page [`tale_home_page.dart`](lib/tale_home_page.dart) containing an app bar and a tab bar:
1. [`widget_localizations_page.dart`](lib/TabViewPages/widget_localizations_page.dart): show pref info about this delegate which provided by flutter to localized widget directionality.
2. [`material_localizations_page.dart`](lib/TabViewPages/material_localizations_page.dart): shows all material localized value, usually used behind the scene by Material components, and can be accessed anywhere in widgets tree. 
3. [`cupertino_localizations_page.dart`](lib/TabViewPages/cupertino_localizations_page.dart): as material but for ios components (cupertino), and also can be accessed anywhere in widgets tree.
